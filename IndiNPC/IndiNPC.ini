Description = The One-Day NPC concept was originally conceived by Jason Compton of PPG, who I believe was just feeling left out since he couldn't participate in any of the Iron Modder competitions (what with being the Insane Overlord for the competition and all). The basic idea is that you make an NPC as complete as possible within a 24 hour time-span. I took this idea and proceeded to make a complete and total mockery of it, and present to you: Indira. It took about four months to make, mainly because I procrastinated as only I can.

Indira is a half-elven, lawful good fighter/mage from an area just east of the Baldur's Gate region. She has banters with all BG1 NPCs except Branwen, Coran, Ajantis, Faldorn, and Skie, for a grand total of 20... I think. Check the spoilers section for more info on where to find her, and what she comes equipped with. 

Version 13 comes with an optional component that adds interjections of Indira to some game characters' dialogue. This is content that already was in the mod but was never added to the game. It is available now in the hope that this is the author's intend. THe component is flagged BETA because it was not tested yet.

The mod is compatible with Tutu, BGT, BG:EE, and EET.
