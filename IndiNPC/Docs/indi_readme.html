  <b>I. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general"></a>
  <p>The One-Day NPC concept was originally conceived by Jason Compton of PPG, who I believe was just feeling left
out since he couldn't participate in any of the Iron Modder competitions (what with being the Insane Overlord for
the competition and all).  The basic idea is that you make an NPC as complete as possible within a 24 hour time-span.
I took this idea and proceeded to make a complete and total mockery of it, and present to you: Indira.  It took about
four months to make, mainly because I procrastinated as only I can.
<p>
Due to some coding issues, I was unable to make her compatible with BG1 sans Tutu, and so converted her to a Tutu-compatible format.
<p>
Indira is a half-elven, lawful good fighter/mage from an area just east of the Baldur's Gate region.  She 
has banters with all BG1 NPCs except Branwen, Coran, Ajantis, Faldorn, and Skie, for a grand total of 20... I think.
Check the <a href="#spoilers">spoilers</a> section for more info on where to find her, and what she comes equipped with.
<p><p>
Version 13 comes with an optional component that adds interjections of Indira to some game characters' dialogue. This is content that already was in the mod but was never added to the game. It is available now in the hope that this is the author's intend. THe component is flagged BETA because it was not tested yet.

  <p><a NAME="install"><b>II. INSTALLATION</b></a>
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">Run the file "IndiraNPC_V9.exe".  From there, it should automatically determine the location of your Tutu install.
    <li TYPE="i">If your Tutu path is different from what's displayed, change it manually, then continue with the installation.
  </ol>
  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp; We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, and .tlk-based mods.&nbsp;
  If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please send the file SETUP-INDINPC.DEBUG
  to </a><a HREF="mailto:ghreyfain@pocketplane.net">ghreyfain@pocketplane.net</a>.
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="uninstall"><b>III. UNINSTALLATION</b></a>
  <p>Uninstalling is simple. Double-click the setup-indiNPC.exe file and enter the
  given commands for Uninstallation.<br>
  Afterwards, you may delete the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>setup-indiNPC.exe
    <li>The &quot;IndiNPC&quot; subfolder
  </ul>

  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>IV. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>Q: Where can I find Indira?<br>
  A: She is in the Firewine Ruins, near the entrance from the halfling inn.
  <p>Q: What equipment/spells does Indira come with?<br>
  A: She comes with a small array of low level spells, a broken weapon, a custom-fitted
chain shirt that allows for spell-casting, and a few scavenged kobold arrows for her bow.
She's in a sorry state, that's for sure.

  <p>The creation of Indira was a not particularly rigorous and not terribly gruelling ordeal of constant slacking
and procrastination.  It would not have been possible without the (hard?) work of the following people:
