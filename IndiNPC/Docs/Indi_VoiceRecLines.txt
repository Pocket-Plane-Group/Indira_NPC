Right, the basic gist with Indira is that she's a rookie adventurer who's really enthusiastic, eager to please,
eager to find excitement, but can be a bit whiny when things get rough.

---------------------------

Okay, so these lines are from her banters with other NPCs.  I think it's fairly obvious which ones are hers
and which aren't.

Xzar
X: "You're a-scaring MEEEE!  Leave me alone, witchy witch!"
Indi: "Funny, I was about to say the same of you.  I think we'll have no problems granting each other's wishes."

Montaron
Indi: "Whoa!  Watch where you're swinging that blade!  You almost caught me in the knee!"

Garrick
G: "As you may know, Indi, I've been writing down the details of our epic adventure, but I'm getting rather bored of it."
I: "Bored?  If someone should chance to ask me, I'd call my time in the party anything but boring."

Kagain
K: "Hey, stop!  That ring you're wearing is the one I found on that dead gnoll!  Missy, if you've been pilferin' more than your share of the loot, you're gonna' get such a tanning."
I: "Ring?  What, THIS ring?  I've had this since I left home!  What are you trying to pull?"

Jaheira
J: "Indira, your talents with magic are quite impressive, but I wonder whether you'll ever truly learn how to use that talent."
I: "Oh, I'll improve, you mark my words.  What I know now is nothing compared to what I'm going to learn."

Khalid
I: "That was a nice trick you pulled last battle, Khalid.  I didn't think anyone expected it."

Kivan
K: "Move quickly, Indi.  There is no time for idling about."
I: "I wasn't idling, I was just thinking!"

Edwin
E: "One of these days, Indi, I shall expect your magic will fail you.  It's just been luck that's kept you alive so far."
I: "I'm of the opinion that people make their own luck, Edwin.  Some people make it harder for themselves than others, though."

Dynaheir
D: "I have been thinking, Indira, that it seems many of the attributes Minsc and I have between the two of us are bottled up together in that thin frame of yours."
   "How must it be to contain so many... conflicting signals."
I: "What are you trying to say?  I think I have a bit firmer grip on reality than Minsc, and you, well, I can't say I'm quite as... 'proud' as you are."

Xan
I: "Cheer up, Xan.  Soon we'll find out who's behind things and you can go back to Evereska."

Shar-teel
S: "How can someone so puny do so well in battle?  It's amazing to watch you fight."
I: "You mean to say you've had the chance to watch me fight, and didn't joined in to help?  Gee, thanks."

Viconia
V: "Among the female drow, it is considered a vile degradation of oneself to practice arcane magic, or to rely solely on physical prowess in battle.  I find it amusing that you do both.  It's almost as if you were a lowly male."
I: "Just leave me alone, Viconia.  I didn't ask for your opinion."

Eldoth
E: "Indi, be a darling and help me with this equipment.  You strut about like a peacock while I seem to be treated like the group's pack-mule."
I: "Despite your overacting, you still don't look like you're carrying any more than you ought to be, Eldoth."

Quayle
Q: "Indi!  Think fast!  What's the sum of the root of seven quadrangles appended vertically over the north arc of a circle?"
I: "Five?"

Tiax
I: "Ouch!  Tiax, you just stepped on my toe.  On purpose!"

Safana
S: "So tell me, Indira, what do you hope to gain by flaunting your stuff in front of the boys?"
I: "Flaunting?  I don't know what you're talking about."
------------------------------------

And that's it for banter.  These lines are from her intial joining dialogue, where she's trapped in the Firewine
Ruins by kobolds, so she's pretty desperate and scared.  She mistakes the PC for bad guys at first.
~Away!  You'll not take me without a fight!~


About to be kicked form the party:
~You don't want me any more?  But I... I can do so much!~


The party returns, after having kicked her out:
~You're back!  What do you say?  Time to get back together and go on adventures!  I've been sharpening my blade and keeping my aim up.~
--------------------------------

Then we've got the selection and confirmation and death lines and all that jazz.

If you could name the files as indicated in the brackets--[J#indi02] would be J#indi02.wav, for instance--that'd
be great.

For the damage and dying sounds, just do whatever's easiest for you.

  SAY MORALE ~Ah!  This is too much!  I... I'm sorry, I've got to go!~ [J#indi02]
  SAY HAPPY ~This is just great!  I bet we could hire a bard who'd write down our tales!~ [J#indi03]
  SAY UNHAPPY_ANNOYED ~I just can't understand why you're doing this.  It's not right.~ [J#indi04]
  SAY UNHAPPY_SERIOUS ~I never wanted this to happen!  Everything's going horribly wrong!~ [J#indi05]
  SAY UNHAPPY_BREAKING ~This is it!  I just... I can't go on.  I'm sorry.~ [J#indi06]
  SAY LEADER ~Um, are you sure you want me at the front?  I mean, ah, I have my sword but I'm all puny and stuff!~ [J#indi07]
  SAY TIRED ~Can we stop soon?  My legs feel like they're on fire and my sword is getting HEAV-Y.~ [J#indi08]
  SAY BORED ~Isn't there something else we could be doing?  Like... anything?  Maybe?  Please?~ [J#indi09]
  SAY BATTLE_CRY1 ~Have at ye, villains!  Haha!~ [J#indi10]
  SAY DAMAGE ~~ [J#indi11]
  SAY DYING ~~ [J#indi12]
  SAY HURT ~Healing!  Quick!  Please!~ [J#indi13]
  SAY AREA_FOREST ~Y'know, my home was almost like this.  Sort of.  Only not.~ [J#indi14]
  SAY AREA_DUNGEON ~Y'know, I heard dwarves actually live in places like this.  Is that true?~ [J#indi15]
  SAY AREA_CITY ~Y'know, I really like the city.  Too bad about the smell, though.~ [J#indi16]
  SAY AREA_DAY ~Y'know, I sure do enjoy the sunshine.  Rain, too.  Snow's okay, I guess.~ [J#indi17]
  SAY AREA_NIGHT ~Y'know, if I weren't so brave, I'd probably be sort of spooked right now.  But I'm not!  No sirree.  Not me.  Nope.~ [J#indi18]
  SAY SELECT_COMMON1 ~I'm all set!~ [J#indi19]
  SAY SELECT_COMMON2 ~Who, me?~ [J#indi20]
  SAY SELECT_COMMON3 ~Ready to go!~ [J#indi21]
  SAY SELECT_ACTION1 ~Time to get to business!~ [J#indi22]
  SAY SELECT_ACTION2 ~Yeah!~ [J#indi23]
  SAY SELECT_ACTION3 ~You said it!~ [J#indi24]
